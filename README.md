</h3>

<hr/>

> During Israel's second lockdown, the parliament [passed a bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Israel#Protests) to prevent citizens from protesting more than 1km from their homes. This happened right as a nation-wide protest movement had spread across the country.
>
> 1km.co.il was created to encourage citizens to protest in their neighborhoods, despite the undemocratic restrictions.
>
> Over 20 contributors from various fields - developers, designers, project managers and social media specialists - made it possible for more than 250,000 people to find a protest near their home.

## Introduction

- A solid knowledge of (and a desire to) React is recommended before dwelling into the code.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is here to keep our the data and host our assets.
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) ensures we have a single source of truth - not so obvious these days.
- We color our protest signs with [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/).

## Installation
